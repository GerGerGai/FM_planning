## How to get dataset:
1. replace diffuser/diffuser/datasets/buffer.py with the buffer.py file in this repo.
2. download process_d4rl_data.py and put it in the same parent directory of the diffuser repo:
     Parent_Directory
           |
           | - - diffuser
           |
           |-- process_d4rl_data.py
 3. run process_d4rl_data.py
 4. the dataset will be stored in a processed_data folder within the same directory as process_d4rl_data.py
